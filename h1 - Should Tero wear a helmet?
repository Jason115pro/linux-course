x) Threat Model
1. What is threat modeling?
Threat modeling is analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics. At the highest levels, we ask four key questions:
  What are we working on?
  What can go wrong?
  What are we going to do about it?
  Did we do a good enough job?

2. Why threat model?
It allows you to recognize potential failures and pinpoint design issues requiring mitigation early in the system's lifetime. The output informs decisions in design, development, and testing.

3. Who should threat model?
Everyone. Anyone concerned about the privacy, safety, and security of their system.

4. The Threat Modeling Manifesto
The Manifesto is a methodology-agnostic guide based on:
  Values: Relative worth .
  Principles: Fundamental truths, including recommended patterns and anti-patterns to avoid.

a)Security hygiene
Definition & Key Measures
Security hygiene refers to the fundamental, routine practices that individuals and organizations perform to maintain system health. 
Core habits include:
  MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): Protecting identity.
  Patch Management: Regularly update software.
  Internet security: Do not use public Wi-Fi.

b)Make-belief boogie-man -FPS game-
(1) What are we working on?
    We are developing a competitive "FPS (First-Person Shooter) Game".
    Assets: Player's Personal Identifiable Information and payment tools.
    Narrative: Developed through collaboration between business leads and technical experts to ensure data availability, system integrity, and player privacy.

(2) What can go wrong? 
    Information Disclosure: Leakage of player accounts or sensitive payment data.
    Risk Calculation: 10% probability of breach $\times$ €2,000,000 (Legal fines&brand damage) = €200,000 Expected Value.

(3) What are we going to do about it? 
  Applying META strategies:
  Mitigate: Secure transactions using SSL/TLS encryption protocols.
  Eliminate: Use third-party payment tokens to avoid storing raw credit card details on internal servers.
  Accept: Accept minimal risks related to non-critical service interruptions.

(4) Did we do a good enough job? 
  This is a continuous process. 
  We ensure effectiveness through regular penetration testing, anti-cheat updates, and constant threat reassessment.
