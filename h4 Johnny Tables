1.OWASP A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
  This vulnerability occurs when the system fails to properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do.
  Attackers bypass authorization to access unauthorized functionality or data, such as accessing other users' accounts, viewing sensitive files, or gaining admin privileges.
  It’s fascinating how we often focus so much on the authentication but forget to lock the authorization

2.OWASP A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
  Key Point: Security risks arising from insecure default settings, incomplete configurations, or poorly managed cloud storage.
  This happens when developers leave default passwords unchanged, keep unnecessary features enabled, or allow verbose error messages that leak system technical details.
  This is often the result of "speed over security". Leaving default settings active is like leaving the factory-set code on a new home security system.
